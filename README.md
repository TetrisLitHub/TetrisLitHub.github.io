Just a personal website I made, the first test version i made myself using extremely basic HTML knowledge but the current version right now was made with google docs exported as html.
# what's secret.html?
You'll find out, just go to TetrisLitHub.github.io/secret :)
# what's chat.hmtl?
just some experiment i made because I wanted to see if python could send requests to a website and have the website print it to create some chat thing.
