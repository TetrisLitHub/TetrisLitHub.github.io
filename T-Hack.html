<p>This is the official website of T-Hack, a Minecraft Forge 1.12.2 hack client/utility mod by TheTetrisDude/TetrisLitHub.</p>
<ul>
<li>This is just a quick website I made in like five minutes, and the website will probably be updated to a more complete version in the future!</li>
<li>You can download and view information on T-Hack at the GitHub repo: <a href="https://github.com/TetrisLitHub/TetrisLitHub.github.io">https://github.com/TetrisLitHub/TetrisLitHub.github.io</a></li>
<li>I made this client for fun and to improve my Java skills and also to introduce myself to Minecraft modding. It's not really a good client nor do I plan on making it a top tier hack client in the future.</li>
<li>(BTW it's not a RAT, you can see the source code for yourself)</li>
</ul>
